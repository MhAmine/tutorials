Metadata in spatial data can be easily extracted in a few steps. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(rgdal)
root_folder_path <- "dir1/dir2/"
folder_name <- "folder_name" #name of folder containing shapefiles and associated data
spatial_obj <- readOGR(dsn = paste0(folder_path, folder_name),
              layer = folder_name)
spatial_df <- spatial_obj@data #save data as a dataframe
spatial_obj@proj4string #get coordinate unit information
```
