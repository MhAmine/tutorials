title: "Extracting EML metadata using R"

Each dataset in the [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io/) has associated metadata that displays on the data package page (for example, [here](doi.org/10.18739/A2X86K)), which can also be downloaded as an *.xml file. 

You can scroll through attribute (variable) metadata in the *Attribute Information* section of a Data Table or Other Entity, but sometimes it's easier to have examine this information using tabular data.

Thankfully, this is easily done using the `EML` package in R!

Start by downloading the EML file to a local directory. Alternatively, use `RCurl` to download the file from my github directory and follow along. Use `read_eml()` to load it into your R environment.

```{r echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(RCurl)
library(EML)

eml_web <- RCurl::getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isteves/tutorials/master/data/LeConte_meteo_metadata.xml")
eml <- read_eml(eml_web) 
# if you've downloaded the *.xml file, replace eml_web with your file path 
#(i.e., "home/isteves/my_metadata.xml")
```

We usually only have attributes for data tables, which we can grab from our EML using `eml_get`. 

```{r}
attributes <- eml_get(eml, "attributeList")
```

The variable, `attributes`, now has all the attribute information in the package stored as a list. For this example, we have three attribute objects.

```{r}
class(attributes)
length(attributes)
```

Each list object contains another list of 2 objects: (1) *attribute* information in the form of a dataframe and (2) *factors* to store information about enumerated domains within the dataset. A column titled "Fruit", for example, may include data (`c("o", "g", "p", "o")`) as factors (o = orange, g = grape, p = pineapple).

To extract a single dataframe and save it to a csv, simply run:

```{r eval = FALSE}
attribute1 <- attributes[[1]]$attributes
write.csv(attribute1, "attribute1.csv")
```

To save all attributes, a for loop makes it easy:

```{r eval = FALSE}
for(i in 1:length(attributes)){
  attribute1 <- attributes[[i]]$attributes
  file_name <- paste0("attribute", i, ".csv")
  write.csv(attribute1, file_name)
}
```

...and you're done!
